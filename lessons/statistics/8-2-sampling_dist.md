[Think Stats Chapter 8 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2009.html#toc77) (scoring)

>> REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR RESPONSE
With `n=9` I got the following result:

```
Standard error is 0.8724305577706931
Confidence interval is (1.3182914738194371, 3.7413194370536917)
```

After setting `n=900` I calculated the following standard error and confidence
interval:

```
Standard error is 0.06543285681685873
Confidence interval is (1.8953008487635326, 2.1160289156523064)

```

As I increase the sample size, the confidence interval converges to the real
`lam=2`.
